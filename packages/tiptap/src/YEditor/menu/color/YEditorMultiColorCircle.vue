  <!--
   * As we are using the native <input type="color">, we get different behaviors based on each browser.
   * When the input value gets modified by the user, the input triggers a change event that we can listen to.
   * Chrome and Edge will display a simple color picker to let the user create a custom color and by clicking outside of it, it will close and trigger the change event
   * Firefox will display a more complex color picker as a separate window with more interactions, that once manually closed, will trigger the change event
   * Safari will first display a color picker with predefined choices, and by clicking on a button, will display a more complex color picker to create a custom color (as Google Sheet or Excel)
   * If we click on one of the predefined colors, the change event will be triggered
   * If we want to use the more complex color picker to create a custom color, the problem is that each time we would change a value in this color picker, the change event will be fired, resulting in a new color added in our situation
   * The problem has been discussed here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/62055129 and explain why the blur event is used
   * Adding a browser detection will probably not help as Safari triggers the change event on the first pre-defined color picker
   * See https://github.com/reteach/reteach-app/pull/2581#issue-1933228007 for a better visual understanding
   *
   * This solution is a workaround for the custom color picker on Safari, working fine in Chrome & Edge but giving a not very friendly UX on Firefox and in the first color picker of Safari
   * We decided with the UX team to give priority to Safari users over Firefox users as they will likely be more numerous
